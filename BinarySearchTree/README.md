Binary Search Tree

 

Create a program that creates a binary search tree. You will be creating tree nodes which have two children and a data value. (This is similar to a linked list with two next pointers, left and right.) The program should read in a series of numbers (either from the console or from a file) between 1 and 999, separated by a single space, and it should correctly place them in the tree. You should also be able to remove particular numbers from the tree and update it correctly. You should be able to enter a number and ask if it is in the tree (search). Finally, you should create a visual way of representing the tree. (It should print out the tree showing all of the parent-child relationships. This will make debugging easier.)

In general, make sure that you can add, remove, and print in any order. I should be able to add five numbers, remove a couple of them, print the tree, add a couple more, print the tree, delete one, etc.

Visual shows binary search tree correctly:  10 points

Numbers are added correctly:  10 points

Numbers are removed correctly (NOTE: THIS IS NOT TRIVIAL; make sure the three cases are covered, including deleting the root):  15 points

Can ask the tree if a number is contained in it. (Search): 5 points

You should have comments. While there are no points for them, if you do not include them, you have shamed yourself. And your family. And your ancestors.
